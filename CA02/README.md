The python notbook contains codes for a email spam classider by using Naive Bayes. The Accuracy 
score will be provided at the end after evaluation of the comparison between the predicted labels 
and test labels. The program contains libiraries such as os, numpy, Counter, pandas, GaussianNB,
and accuracy_score. multiple models or structres were created to slice and filter the emails under
certain conditions. by slicing sentences into strings, and define words from strings, def function 
and for loop were used, as well as the os function when reading the data. define particular letters
within words was important in this process too, in the end, we were able to store the words into a 
dictionary for later tests. In this program, we have tested the train-mails and test-mails data,
created x and y labels for both the train and test mails datasets, and finally train the model with
Naive Bayes algorithm. The accurrcy test score was about 0.9615 after comparing the predicted labels
with test labels, which was a good sign. It means we successfully have about 96.15% of the data were
predicted correctly.
