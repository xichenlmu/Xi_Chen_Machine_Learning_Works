The CA01 Machine Learning work contains 3 parts of Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset of house-price-train.csv. The purpose of doing this is to have clear view of the dataset and turn it into a usful information for analysis. The first part data understanding cantains various visualization for all columns to understand the purpose of each column, as well as the problem that each column has. Plots, graphs, and heat maps were used in this section. The second part data pre-processing contains large data cleanning techniques including define , remove, or replace missing values and outliers. Encoding, binning, normalization, calculation of statistics (correlation), IDness, and check for stability may occur in this section for making a better dataset, managing it, and analyze it. The last part data post processing contains a final visualization of all columns which is a heatmap to compare the correlation of each column before providing the final useful dataset. The comparison can help us to define the columns that are less useful or unnecessary to exist in the dataset, we may then drop the columns from dataset for a better information performance at the end.
